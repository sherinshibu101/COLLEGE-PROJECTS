- **How to test**: Click the "📥 Download Image" button after entering URL

### 3. **Saves to Local Storage** ✅
- **What it does**: Automatically saves downloaded images to device storage
- **Technical**: Uses `MediaStore API` (Android 10+) and `File API` (older versions)
- **Storage Location**: `Pictures/ImageDownloader/` folder
- **How to test**: Check Gallery app or file manager after downloading

### 4. **Displays the Image** ✅
- **What it does**: Shows a large preview of the image in the app
- **Technical**: Uses `AsyncImage` from Coil library with `ContentScale.Fit`
- **Size**: 400dp height for clear viewing
- **How to test**: Image appears automatically when you enter a valid URL

## 🎯 Additional Features Implemented

- Shows clear error messages if permissions denied

### 8. **User Interface Features** ✅
- Clean, professional Material Design 3 UI
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Color-coded status messages (green=success, red=error, orange=loading)
- Exit app functionality

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Programming Language**: Kotlin
### **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
### **Architecture**: Single Activity with Composable functions
### **Key Libraries**:
- `Coil` - Image loading and caching
- `Kotlinx Coroutines` - Asynchronous operations
- `Material 3` - Modern UI components

### **Permissions Required**:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
```

## 🎓 What to Explain to Your Teacher

### **Simple Explanation**:
"This app lets users download images from the internet. You paste a link, the app downloads the image, saves it to your phone's Pictures folder, and shows you where it's saved. It also keeps a history of your downloads."

### **Technical Explanation**:
"The app uses Android's MediaStore API for file storage, Coil library for image loading, and Jetpack Compose for the user interface. It handles permissions properly and uses coroutines for asynchronous network operations."
